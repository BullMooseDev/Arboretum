in this project I want to create a arborists site. It will have a cool CSS of a forest of different trees that will have the ability to be clicked on and then show the user the ways it supports local wildlife and how its a beneficial native plant. I also think it would be nice to integrate a method for users to find where one could purchase the plant.

IDEAS:
-The plants grow in size slightly when moused over
-rather than a redirect, completely change the page with react to show the clicked on plants info
-bushes and other plants?
-make it a live site, heroku or other.
-add multiple tabs for trees/bushes/etc

TREES:
-red maple
-loblolly pine
-sweetgum
-douglus fir
-quaking aspen
-sugar maple
-balsam fir
-flowering dogwood
-lodgepole pine
-white oak
-american mountain ash
-american persimmon
-cherry
-common hackberry
-hawthorns
-red mullberry
-serviceberry
-basswood
-beech
-birches
-black walnut
-hickory
-oak
-spruce

// It would be cool to add a easter egg in the trees of a spider, when clicked shows a "the hobbit 1977" like scene
